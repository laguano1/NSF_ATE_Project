# Step 1: Define the Hypothesis
# Note: I'm testing if changing the 'Add to Cart' button color from blue to red will increase the click-through rate.
# Hypothesis: "Changing the color of the 'Add to Cart' button from blue to red will increase the click-through rate."

# Step 2: Collect Data
# Note: I'll generate sample data for this A/B test. This includes user_id, group assignment (A or B), and whether the user clicked the 'Add to Cart' button.
np.random.seed(42)  # Ensuring reproducibility
data = {
    'user_id': range(1, 201),  # 200 users in total
    'group': ['A'] * 100 + ['B'] * 100,  # 100 users see the blue button, 100 see the red button
    'click': np.concatenate([np.random.binomial(1, 0.1, 100), np.random.binomial(1, 0.2, 100)])  # 10% CTR for blue, 20% CTR for red
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Step 3: Split the Data
# Note: I'll split the data into two groups based on the button color each group saw.
group_a = df[df['group'] == 'A']
group_b = df[df['group'] == 'B']

# Step 4: Calculate the Mean Click-Through Rate for Each Group
# Note: I'll calculate the average click-through rate (CTR) for both groups to understand their performance.
mean_a = group_a['click'].mean()
mean_b = group_b['click'].mean()

# Step 5: Perform a Two-Sample T-Test
# Note: The t-test will compare the means of the two groups to see if the differences are statistically significant.
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group_a['click'], group_b['click'])

# Step 6: Show Results
# Note: I'll print the mean CTR for both groups, the t-statistic, and the p-value.
print(f"Group A (Blue) Mean CTR: {mean_a:.2%}")
print(f"Group B (Red) Mean CTR: {mean_b:.2%}")
print(f"T-Statistic: {t_stat}")
print(f"P-Value: {p_value}")

# Interpret the Result
# Note: If the p-value is less than 0.05, the difference between the groups is statistically significant.
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("There is a significant difference between the two groups.")
    if mean_b > mean_a:
        print("The red 'Add to Cart' button increases the click-through rate.")
    else:
        print("The red 'Add to Cart' button decreases the click-through rate.")
else:
    print("There is no major difference between the two groups.")

# Additional: Calculate Confidence Intervals
# Note: I'll calculate the 95% confidence intervals for both groups to understand the range of the true mean.
confidence_level = 0.95
degrees_freedom = len(group_a) + len(group_b) - 2
confidence_interval_a = stats.t.interval(confidence_level, degrees_freedom, mean_a, stats.sem(group_a['click']))
confidence_interval_b = stats.t.interval(confidence_level, degrees_freedom, mean_b, stats.sem(group_b['click']))

print(f"95% Confidence Interval for Group A (Blue): {confidence_interval_a}")
print(f"95% Confidence Interval for Group B (Red): {confidence_interval_b}")
